[SDL](https://sdlang.org/) (Simple Declarative Language) for Java
============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SingingBush/SDL.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SingingBush/SDL)

> SDLang is a simple and concise way to textually represent data. It has an XML-like structure – tags, values and attributes – which makes it a versatile choice for data serialization, configuration files, or declarative languages. Its syntax was inspired by the C family of languages (C/C++, C#, D, Java, …).

### Forked from [ikayzo/SDL](https://github.com/ikayzo/SDL):

This code was originally dumped in github in May 2011 with a single commit message stating that it was migrated from svn.

Since then there's been no activity and it seems that issues are ignored. Even the URL for documentation is broken.

The project seemed to be abandoned so I've forked it with the initial goal of

- publishing build artifacts to maven
- enable continuous integration
- keep project alive
